# Handwritten Notes

I make a lot of notes while studying and reading books.
I do this on a reMarkable tablet, v2.
I like writing on paper, because the free-form lets me get my ideas down fluidly, or take notes effectively.
This is really similar to using paper, it's a neat tool and it helps me keep my writing organised, as opposed to pages and switching between notebooks/notepads.

I'm keeping my handwritten notes in here.

Also, for fun, I'm using their software to convert my handwritten notes to text, just to see if it's remotely accurate.
I don't think it will be, deciphering someone's handwriting can be pretty difficult for humans to start with, I imagine even harder to teach that to machines.
But I'll leave it exactly as it gets generated, just for comparison.
